                    Belief Charity is the act of giving help to those in need of it. It is a humanitarian act. It involves
                    giving money, goods or time and effort to those who need it. It is done without expecting something
                    in return. Giving money or food to poor people is an example of charity. Poor, sick or injured
                    people are generally considered the proper people to whom charity should be given. When such people
                    are not supported, they often begin begging, which is directly asking for help from people they do
                    not know. Others may rely on support from charitable organizations. These organizations collect
                    money and goods and then give them to those in need.
                    Most charities are concerned with providing basic needs, such as food, water, clothing, health care
                    and shelter. The most common form of charity is donating money. The money is then used to buy these
                    basic needs. However, there are many other actions that may be performed as charity, such as
                    teaching orphans, donating blood, or money to help fund medical research.
